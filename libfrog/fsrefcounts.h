/*
 *	Structure for FS_IOC_GETFSREFCOUNTS.
 *
 *	The memory layout for this call are the scalar values defined in
 *	struct fsrefs_head, followed by two struct fsrefs that describe the
 *	lower and upper bound of mappings to return, followed by an array of
 *	struct fsrefs mappings.
 *
 *	fch_iflags control the output of the call, whereas fch_oflags report
 *	on the overall record output.  fch_count should be set to the length
 *	of the fch_recs array, and fch_entries will be set to the number of
 *	entries filled out during each call.  If fch_count is zero, the number
 *	of refcount mappings will be returned in fch_entries, though no
 *	mappings will be returned.  fch_reserved must be set to zero.
 *
 *	The two elements in the fch_keys array are used to constrain the
 *	output.  The first element in the array should represent the lowest
 *	disk mapping ("low key") that the user wants to learn about.  If this
 *	value is all zeroes, the filesystem will return the first entry it
 *	knows about.  For a subsequent call, the contents of
 *	fsrefs_head.fch_recs[fsrefs_head.fch_count - 1] should be copied into
 *	fch_keys[0] to have the kernel start where it left off.
 *
 *	The second element in the fch_keys array should represent the highest
 *	disk mapping ("high key") that the user wants to learn about.  If this
 *	value is all ones, the filesystem will not stop until it runs out of
 *	mapping to return or runs out of space in fch_recs.
 *
 *	fcr_device can be either a 32-bit cookie representing a device, or a
 *	32-bit dev_t if the FCH_OF_DEV_T flag is set.  fcr_physical and
 *	fcr_length are expressed in units of bytes.  fcr_owners is the number
 *	of owners.
